Project Overview
This is my personal portfolio website built for the INFR3120 Web and Script Programming course. It’s a place to show my work, highlight my skills, and give people an easy way to get in touch with me.
Live Site

Color Scheme
 I put together my colors using Adobe Color. The five I went with are:
Primary: #264653 (dark blue-green)


Secondary: #2A9D8F (teal)


Accent 1: #E9C46A (yellow-gold)


Accent 2: #F4A261 (orange)


Accent 3: #E76F51 (coral red)


I chose these because they feel professional but still friendly, and they have good contrast so text is easy to read.
Responsive Design
 I made sure the site works on all common screen sizes:
Desktop / Laptop: 960px and up


Tablet: 481px to 960px


Mobile: 480px and below


These breakpoints are pretty standard. 960px splits nicely for column layouts, and 480px covers most phones in portrait mode.
 I used a fluid layout (percentage widths), seperate CSS files for each screen size, and made buttons/tap targets big enough for touch screens (at least 44×44px).
CSS Gradients
 I added a few gradients to make things look less flat:
Linear gradient on the page background for depth.


Angled linear gradient in the header/banner to make it more dynamic.


Radial gradient on skill/project boxes to draw attention.

index.html – Home page with intro and nav
